# Introduction: towards reproducible science using version control and GNU R

## Reproducible science


**Reproducibility** is "the ability to recompute data analytic results given an observed dataset and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline" (Leek & Peng 2015)


## How can we get there?

Quoting (Leek & Peng 2015):

* the raw data from the experiment are available
* the statistical code and documentation to reproduce the analysis are available
* correct data analysis must be performed

Today, we will focus on the second point and explore tools which can help us to allow others to understand and reproduce the data analysis. Note that *others* may include yourself, 2 months later. ;)

## Tools we will get to know:

* Git - a version control system (VCS). This allows one to access different versions of files, find the old version of a script you used when you published Paper XY, etc.
* Two R packages that help with reproducible research:
  * rmarkdown
  * apaTables

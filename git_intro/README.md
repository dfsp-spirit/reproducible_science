# Introduction to Git

## What is Git?

Git is a *version control system*, i.e., a software that allows you to manage different versions of files in a repository.

Git can be used to:
* save and access different versions of single files or a whole project
* work on the same set of (text) files with several people and solve the resulting conflicts (*cf* software development)
* do many complex things which are specific to software development that we do not care about today

In science, git provides solutions to the following problems:
* You messed up your R script today when working on it, and you want to get the version from yesterday back.
* You want to know the settings you used when computing the data for paper XY, but you have changed the script in the meantime.
* You want to see the changes introduced to a script since last month.
* Both you and a colleague made changes to the same script. You want to merge them to create a new version based on both change sets.
* You are working on a script over time, and you want colleagues to be able to access the latest version (without sending emails to them after every change)
* You want colleagues or others to be able to see your code, and maybe even allow them to directly make or suggest changes (which you can accept or refuse)

Git is **not**:
* An online document editor that allows several people to collaborate live on the same Word/Excel/whatever document
* A backup solution
* A direct replacement for file hosting or sharing services like DropBox


Alternatives to Git include [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), [Darcs](http://darcs.net/), and [Apache Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/).
